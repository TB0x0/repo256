A portable encryption/decryption suite with gui capability 

[in progress] - Create main function that receives flags for encryption type, file, etc

[not started] - Implement encryption and decryption (chacha alg first) for small files (i.e. fit in buffer)

[not started] - Create simple GUI that will take file, destination path, and encryption type input

[not started] - Implement encryption and decryption for large files (i.e. require buffer streams)
