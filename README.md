A portable encryption/decryption suite with gui capability 

[ ] - Create main function that receives flags for encryption type, file, etc
[ ] - Implement encryption and decryption (chacha alg first) for small files (i.e. fit in buffer)
[ ] - Create simple GUI that will take file, destination path, and encryption type input
[ ] - Implement encryption and decryption for large files (i.e. require buffer streams) 
[ ] - Reiterate step 2-4 to implement improvements to algorithms and GUI
